VisIt was used in some recently published work in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.
You can read the full article titled [Simulation and flow physics of a shocked and reshocked high-energy-density mixing layer](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.1122) there or a [brief overview and short movie here]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples/ex44).
