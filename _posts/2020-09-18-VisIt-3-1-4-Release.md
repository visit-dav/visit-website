OSX support for *Dark Mode* has been temporarily disabled until it is
supported in Qt. In this release, VisIt forces use of *Light Mode* only.

Catalina users should try to grant full disk permission to the terminal first:

If that still doesn't work, then they can run visit from the command line: 
`/Applications/VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/bin/visit`
