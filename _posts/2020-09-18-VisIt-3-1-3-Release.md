OSX support for *Dark Mode* has been temporarily disabled until it is
supported in Qt. In this release, VisIt forces use of *Light Mode* only.

Catalina users should try the grant full disk permission to terminal first: (https://github.com/visit-dav/live-customer-response/issues/111)
If that still doesn't work, then they can run visit from the command line: 
`/Applications/VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/bin/visit`
