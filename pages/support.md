## Methods of Contact

Methods of contact we offer differ in *requirements* and *privacy* level. In
addition, while we try to accommodate a variety of means of *initial contact*,
any issues involving *ongoing dialog* must use only a *preferred* method of
communication. Please read about our
[communication policies](https://visit-sphinx-github-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/develop/dev_manual/SiteReliabilityEngineering.html#supported-methods-of-contact) for more details.

### More details

More recently, we have been
[trying get away from plain ole' email](https://github.com/visit-dav/live-customer-response/wiki/How-the-new-GitHub-visit-users-Email-Integration-Works)
in favor of GitHub issues and for this reason would prefer users contact
us through our [GitHub issue tracker][gh1] whenever possible.

In general, coverage is during normal West Coast business hours, 8am-12pm and
1-5pm (GMT-8, San Francisco time zone), Monday through Friday excluding
[LLNL holidays](https://supplychain.llnl.gov/poattach/pdf/llnl_holidays.pdf)
and response time may be as much as four hours due to team members multi-tasking
among many responsibilities.

If you are so inclined, we welcome you to read more about the VisIt project's
[Site Reliability Engineering](https://visit-sphinx-github-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/develop/dev_manual/SiteReliabilityEngineering.html)
processes to understand how we provide support.

## Supported Platforms

**Note:** Supported platforms periodically change due to any of a number of
factors including demand, developer access, technology obsolescence, and majority
stakeholder requirements.

### Fully Supported

The platforms upon which the majority of contributors regularly develop and
run VisIt and for which the resources exist to provide *full support* are determined
primarily by our [host organization](https://wci.llnl.gov). For these platforms, we
are able to reproduce bugs, test bug-fixes, develop work-arounds and in general provide
the highest quality support services. These platforms are...

* Windows 7, 8 and 10
* RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.5
* macOS 10.14 and 10.15

### Partially Supported

We do make an effort to provide pre-compiled binaries as well as perform minimal testing
for other variants of Linux. However, because we do not yet routinely develop or test on
these platforms, we are not able to provide the same level of support.

* Ubunto 16, 18, 19 and 20
* Centos 8
* Debian 9 and 10
* Fedora 27 and 31

### Other Platforms

For other *standard* platforms, building VisIt from sources using the
[`build_visit`](https://visit-sphinx-github-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/develop/gui_manual/Building/index.html?highlight=build_visit)
[bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) script is an option.
If issues are encountered doing so, depending on demand for the associated platform
we may be interested in collaborating to resolve them. However, the more exotic the
platform, the less demand and the lower in priority we must make resolving `build_visit` issues.
