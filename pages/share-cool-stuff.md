If you have used VisIt in ways you think are interesting or novel to analyze 
and visualize data, we'd love to hear from you.

We invite you to consider writing a short article for our blog and/or
sending us some cool, high resolution images with captions which we would be
happy to publish in our gallery. Or, if you want please just post a note to our
[*Share cool stuff* discussion](https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/discussions/categories/share-cool-stuff).
