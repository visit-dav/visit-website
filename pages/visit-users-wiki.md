The VisIt project is grateful to [Brad Whitlock](https://github.com/BradWhitlock) for maintaing the VisIt Users wiki since first starting it in 2007.
To visit the old VisIt User's Wiki, follow [this link](https://visitusers.org)

Be aware that content there has slowly fallen out of date as VisIt has evolved.
This is particularly true of *user* content. More of the *developer* content remains current.
Consequently, we have been migrating content from the old wiki to our new [ReadTheDocs](https://visit-sphinx-github-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) pages.
There, we believe such content is more likely to remain current as we now employ a [docs-like-code](https://www.docslikecode.com/about/#page-title) development workflow.
We've started with key user tutorials.

Migrating content involves converting it from [WikiMedia](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting) format to [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html).
If anyone is interested in helping us in this quest, please get in touch with us by opening a new [*Make VisIt better* discussion](https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/discussions/new).
